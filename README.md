# Minimal Alt1/webpack/typescript example

how to use
```sh
#to initialize the repo and install dependencies
npm i
#build
npm run build
#alternatively to auto-rebuild when source files are changed
npm run watch
```

You can open `./dist/index.html` in your browser and it will give some basic functionality based one pasted images.

You can also open it in the Alt1 browser and click the `add app` button that appears to get some basic alt1 functionality.
