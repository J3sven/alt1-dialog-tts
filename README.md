# Alt1 dialog tts

# Development on this project is currently on hold!

The runescape update on 12/06/2023 broke the @alt1/dialog module that this project leans on and I am currently not motivated enough to try and fix this.

Alt1 app that parses dialog boxes in RuneScape into various Text-to-speech APIs

To continue development and build from source:
```sh
#to initialize the repo and install dependencies
npm i
#build
npm run build
#alternatively to auto-rebuild when source files are changed
npm run watch
```
